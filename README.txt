A brief description:

GRASP (Generalizable, Remote, Actuation & Sensing of Processes)/GRASS (Generalizable Remote Actuation & Sensing System) is a unified, generalizable
system that can remotely sense, actuate, and supervise a given process. We plan to demonstrate the versatility of this system by applications in 3 important
areas: Industry 4.0/Smart manufacturing, smart homes/smart cooking, hydroponics.
